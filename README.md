# `num-calc.h` - A Lightweight Numerical Methods Single-Header Library in `C`

This project aims to implements a collection of common numerical methods for solving math-related problems, prototyping algorithms or anything related to scientific computing. Optimized for speed and accuracy. 

## **Features** 
- **Modular**: Every piece of code can be reutilized, rewritten and reimplemented without affecting other parts of the library.
- **No dependencies**: It is enough to have a functional `C` compiler and `std-` library (`stdlib.h, stdbool.h`, etc) for using the library, making it easy to integrate into any `C/C++` project.
- **Easy to use**: Every method is straighfoward, just call a function and you're done.
